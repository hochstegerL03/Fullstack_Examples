        At Kind Kones, we only use ingredients you’d find in your own kitchen – Nothing
        derived from a food laboratory.

        While we take every precaution to prevent cross-contamination and provide a
        pleasant experience for customers with dietary needs, we do make our products in a
        facility with peanuts, tree nuts, coconut, and gluten. If you have any allergies,
        we will be happy to make reasonable accommodations at your request but we cannot
        guarantee any of our products are allergen-free. We encourage you to communicate
        with your server and use your own best judgement in determining what is best for
        your needs.
